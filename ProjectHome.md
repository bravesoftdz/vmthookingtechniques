Creating hooks is applicable in many places, from extending the functionalities of a given program, removing bugs and vulnerabilities, up to forcing the application to behave in a given way. Hooks set in the IAT are commonly used by user-land rootkits to conceal their present in the system (hiding files, registry keys, ports, etc). On the other hand, VMT hooks are used mostly in game-hacking, for creating bots, wallhacks, and similar player “aiders”.
